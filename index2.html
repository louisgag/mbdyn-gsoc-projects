<h2>TODO list</h2>
<p>This page presents a list of ideas for possible future development <em>(e.g. for <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a>; see for example <strong>MBDyn</strong>'s participation in <a href="https://www.mbdyn.org/?News&amp;id=14">Google Summer of Code 2015</a>)</em></p>
<p>Most projects require some knowledge of using (and programming for) Linux, because the software is mainly intended for such operating system and environment.</p>
<p>For more information do not hesitate to get in touch with the <strong>MBDyn</strong> community (e.g. using the <em>mbdyn-users@mbdyn.org</em> <a href="?Mailing_Lists">mailing list</a>). In fact, please do get in touch with us to know more about these possible collaborations.  It is much easier to prepare a good application for GSoC if you are already familiar with the project and the code.</p>
<p>If you are an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>experienced <strong>MBDyn</strong> user/developer</em></span>, and want to become a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>mentor</em></span>, please let us know.</p>
<p>The ideas presented here are a basis to stimulate interested students and developers; new ideas will happily be considered. We will also be happy to consider applications focusing on one specific item of a proposed project, as long as it justifies the amount of work planned.</p>

<h4><a name="User_Interface_Components"></a></h4>
<h4>1. User Interface Components</h4>
<p><strong>1.a Upgrade the standalone post-processing graphical interface based on Blender:</strong></p>
<p><strong>MBDyn</strong> is a tool which comes without any default graphical user interface. There exists a few standalone post-processing tools, based on EasyAnim, OpenDx and Blender, respectively. The one based on <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is the most up-to-date; it can be easily used to visualize in 3D and render the model structure. However, there is room for improvement; for example, to plot time histories of selected variables, to show import progress and allow interrupting it, set the initial and final time of the import, automatically adjust timesteps when the results file changes, show time in seconds during animation, and allow to individually import elements even when there are no Blender objects in the scene. Other more complex improvements may be to</p>
<ul>
<li>complete the visualization of elements or simply of their "internal" reference frames (currently only an example case is present in the code)</li>
<li>update <strong>MBDyn</strong>'s input file when moving an object in the Blender interface which is linked to a <strong>MBDyn</strong> element</li>
<li>allow running <strong>MBDyn</strong> directly from the Blender interface and animate the results in realtime</li>
<li>allow importing the kinematics directly from NetCDF binary result files instead of from the general text-only output files.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.b Preprocessing simplification</strong></p>
<p>In its current state, owing to the absence of an interface it may be difficult for new users to understand the <strong>MBDyn</strong> scripting language. It would be beneficial to have an interface which simplifies and clarifies the generation of <strong>MBDyn</strong> input files, e.g. to produce "vertical" applications. For example, a Python pre-processor could be implemented, to produce valid <strong>MBDyn</strong> scripts.<br><strong>Programming skills involved:</strong> (scripting) languages, <strong>MBDyn</strong> script<br><strong>Skill level:</strong> easy/medium<br><strong>Mentor:</strong> Louis Gagnon and Pierangelo Masarati</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.c Flexible element graphical interface</strong></p>
<p>Add flexible superelement (“modal” joint) support to existing post-processing tools (e.g. Blender, EasyAnim)</p>
<p><strong>Programming skills involved:</strong> C++, Python, Blender, Finite Element Analysis<br><strong>Skill level:</strong> easy/medium<br><strong>Mentors:</strong> Marco Morandini and Louis Gagnon</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1.d Additional preprocessing functionalities and driver options</strong></p>
<p>The current <strong>MBDyn</strong> parser has a clear and consistent language. However, it does not let the user define <em>if-else</em> conditions, <em>for-while</em> loops, arrays of variables, and use of variables in the strings of <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">node</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">element</span> drives definitions. This leads the users to often rely on external scripting (e.g. Matlab or Python) to generate their own input files. This supplementary step creates additional opportunities for bugs to appear within a model. Adding these features directly to the <strong>MBDyn</strong> parser would thus make the generation of complex multibody models much simpler and more focused.</p>
<p>Another functionality which would simplify the generation of input files would be to allow defining drives with multiple inputs. A string drive with such a feature could be: <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">"(Var1 &lt; Var2) * Var3"</span> and could also allow access to the value of a drive at times different from the current time (offset from the current time). These improved drive options could be implemented in a similar fashion than the node and element plugin variables.</p>

<h4>2. Modeling Capabilities</h4>
<p><strong>2.a Revamp modal joint<br></strong>   - break down the modal joint element into a set of elements/components:<br>        - modal database: FEM model; split const ( = instantiated once) and local (= duplicated) data;<br>       - place const data in shared database, local data in modal joint; avoid unnecessary copy of memory;<br>       - use standard containers for structured data<br>          for example, <br>            + Mat3xN *pOffsetFEMNodes --&gt; std::vector&lt;Vec3&gt; (same as d1rig?)<br>            + Mat3xN *pOffsetMBNodes --&gt; std::vector&lt;Vec3&gt; (same as d2?)<br>            + Mat3xN *pRotMBNodes --&gt; std::vector&lt;Mat3x3&gt; (not used???)<br>        - define a modal dynamics as a "deformable body" element (the structural dynamics part of the existing element)<br>        - define a modal clamp constraint element (as it is now, but separate from dynamics element)<br>        - add a total modal joint (Was: specialized modal constraints, as opposed to clamping a node with the clamp constraint plus a regular joint) this makes it possible to add arbitrary elements connected to the modal element <br>    - add support for “reference” definition based on modal database geometry<br>    - implement/fix support for modal joint in initial assembly</p>

<p><strong>2.b Ground vehicle model development</strong></p>
<p>A semi-trailer truck model was recently developed in <strong>MBDyn</strong> script and this was a first step into adapting the software to ground vehicle analysis. It would be nice to take some concepts used for such an analysis and implement them directly in the <strong>MBDyn</strong> code.</p>
<ul>
<li>take the scripting tricks and joints used in the truck model and incorporate them directly into the <strong>MBDyn</strong> code</li>
<li>improve the MBDyn output to include car, truck, and general ground vehicle data</li>
<li>implement a set of general procedures to carry-on with a vehicle model (ie: SAE testing procedures for fuel consumption, stability, and maneuverability)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.c Wheel (tire model) module improvements</strong></p>
<p>The wheel module developed in <strong>MBDyn</strong> models the dynamic behavior of tires using a rigid ring type of model. During the development of the module, various avenues were envisioned to accelerate the resolution procedure. The documentation and parameter definition of the model would also benefit from a simplification.</p>
<ul>
<li>simplify the module documentation</li>
<li>simplify the mathematical implementation</li>
<li>implement a clear parameter definition method</li>
<li>add camber variation effects</li>
<li>filter the road profile directly inside <strong>MBDyn</strong> instead of during preprocessing with other computing environments (e.g. Octave or Matlab)</li>
<li>implement a lateral tire section profile (currently, only the longitudinal profile is considered by the model)</li>
<li>simplify the ability to change the orientation of the tire</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.d Friction in joints</strong></p>
<p>Friction is not present in all joints from MBDyn, it would however be a nice feature to have it. Thus,</p>
<ul>
<li>improve friction and add it to all joints (suggestion: try a transition force from stick to slip that is higher than slip force)</li>
<li>implement contacts with non-flat surfaces</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.e Cycloidal rotor module improvements</strong></p>
<p>The cyclocopter module currently available in <strong>MBDyn</strong> models the inflow of a cycloidal rotor. It is however limited to 2D aerodynamics models; moreover, the implementation of the double multiple streamtube model is not yet stable. There are different approaches one may take to improve the code,</p>
<ul>
<li>improve the existing double multiple streamtube code (requires aerodynamic skills), or</li>
<li>add a supplementary inflow model, using an external CFD solver such as OpenFOAM (requires CFD skills), or</li>
<li>implement a panel code within <strong>MBDyn</strong>, possibly starting from the already existing vortexje-mbdyn implementation (https://github.com/tuhh-sn/vortexje-mbdyn) (realistic for someone new to aerodynamics)</li>

<h4>3. Inter-Process Communication / Real-Time Simulation (IPC / RT)</h4>
<p><strong>3.a FMI model exchange and co-simulation standard <br> <br></strong>Over the years, various interfaces to popular modeling software have been developed, in some cases even duplicated. However, the implementation in some cases remains unreliable. A good coupling interface rework is needed. <br> <br>The most promising approach is to integrate into <strong>MBDyn</strong> an interface <br>that is based on the <em>Functional Mock-up Interface</em> (FMI) standard, <br>see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.fmi-standard.org/start">https://www.fmi-standard.org/start</a>. <br> <br>Different libraries do exist to ease the effort, e.g. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.fmi-standard.org/downloads">https://www.fmi-standard.org/downloads</a>.</p>
<p><br>The work can be split into independent tasks, in order of priority (high to low).</p>
<ul>
<li>allow <strong>MBDyn</strong> to perform co-simulations as master</li>
<li>allow <strong>MBDyn</strong> to import models</li>
<li>allow <strong>MBDyn</strong> to perform co-simulations as slave</li>

<p><strong>3.c Implement or perfect the existing hooks to Matlab, Octave, Simulink, Scilab, and OpenFOAM</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, various interfaces to popular modeling software have been developed, in some cases even duplicated. However, the implementation in some cases remains unreliable. A good coupling interface rework is needed:</p>

<h4>4. Miscellaneous</h4>
<p><strong>4.a Libraries update</strong></p>
<p>The internal libraries used by MBDyn have a somewhat complicated configuration and could be simplified. Some of them could be generally useful.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>make the libraries installable</li>
<li>abstract libraries in a rational manner, to reduce/eliminate cross-dependencies</li>
<li>replace standard features from broadly available libraries (e.g. STL, Boost); an example is to use shared pointers for features like constitutive laws, drive callers and so forth when useful (native C++ 2011 shared pointers are experimentally in use in some portions of code).</li>
</ul>

<p>  </p>
<p><strong>4.b Package update</strong></p>
<p>A number of modifications can be made to the MBDyn package to extend its usability and improve the user experience and learning curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a comprehensive test suite</li>
<li>make it more compliant to GNU style</li>
<li>improve windows compatibility</li>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.c Configuration update</strong></p>
<p>The configuration of MBDyn can benefit from some improvements which would make it easier to use by a greater number of users. The tasks involved are:</p>
<ul>
<li>test for '_' appended to F77 symbols (recent autoconf does that), (or better: remove all F77 code)</li>
<li>audit all the suite for not-so-GNU systems</li>
<li>add check for make</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>4.e Cascaded analysis</strong></p>
<p>Add support for cascaded models and solutions with rules for each solution to inherit the initial configuration from the final solution of another solution, possibly through "hard" restart; the typical use case is a static solution that prepares the initial configuration for a subsequent initial value problem.</p>

<p><strong>4.f Automatic differentiation</strong></p>
<p>Automatic differentiation is a technique for generating the Jacobian matrix automatically, needed for the nonlinear solver, given the information of the residual vector which is coded in C++ language. At the moment almost all elements in <strong>MBDyn</strong> are using a hand-written contribution to the Jacobian matrix. That approach is time consuming, error prone and difficult to maintain. In addition to that, there is no easy way to check for the correctness of the Jacobian matrix.</p>
<p>Automatic differentiation is also implemented in <strong>MBDyn</strong> but it is still less efficient in terms of CPU time and size of generated machine code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform different benchmarks with open source template meta programming libraries for the matrix/vector domain like blitz++, armadillo and eigen3 and also for the scalar (automatic differentiation) domain like Adolc and CppAD.<br>Check also for recent papers in the area of automatic differentiation and template meta programming (e.g. on <a href="http://www.autodiff.org">www.autodiff.org</a>).<br>Create a report about the techniques those libraries are using (aliasing, lazy evaluation, common sub-expressions, order of memory access, code generation, or just in time code generation, tape mode or tapeless mode, sparse Jacobians). That report also should show how efficient those libraries are in comparison to our current implementation in terms of CPU time and code size. In addition to that it should show how hardware techniques like vectorization (sse/avx) and intrinsic functions of compilers are exploited.</li>
<li>Use a different approach for evaluation of template meta expressions: Instead of scalar domain template meta programs and matrix/vector domain template meta programs, only one domain should be used in order to make it easier for the compiler to optimise the code in terms of CPU time and size of machine code. Make use of the most promising techniques from 1) for the implementation. This part is probably the most difficult task because large parts of the existing library have to be redesigned.<br>However a prototype implementation, which covers the most critical operation, namely the matrix-matrix products, is available and performs even better than equivalent Fortran code.<br>The following topics should be considered:
<ul>
<li>Not all loops should be unrolled in order to reduce code size. In that way the instruction cache should be used less intensively and stall conditions of the CPU should be avoided.</li>
<li>Add support for matrices and vectors with dynamic size.</li>
<li>Automatically create temporary results for sub-expressions which are evaluated more than once.</li>
<li>Implement a simple “cost model” in order to decide whether to create a temporary sub-expression or not.</li>
<li>Use sequential memory access whenever possible.</li>
<li>Use explicit vectorization for all derivatives and also for matrix vector products if the compiler supports it.</li>
<li>Check for aliasing at compile time or at least at runtime. If runtime checking is required, checks should be done in debug mode only.</li>
<li>Check if the __restrict__ keyword of C++ can help to improve performance.</li>
<li>Perform benchmarks with Fortran code generated by automatic differentiation by source code transformation at different optimization levels (-O2, -O3, -Os).</li>
</ul>
