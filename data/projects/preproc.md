The current MBDyn parser has a clear and consistent language. However, it does not let the user define if-else conditions, for-while loops, arrays of variables, and use of variables in the strings of node and element drives definitions. This leads the users to often rely on external scripting (e.g. Matlab or Python) to generate their own input files. This supplementary step creates additional opportunities for bugs to appear within a model. Adding these features directly to the MBDyn parser would thus make the generation of complex multibody models much simpler and more focused.

Another functionality which would simplify the generation of input files would be to allow defining drives with multiple inputs. A string drive with such a feature could be: "(Var1 < Var2) * Var3" and could also allow access to the value of a drive at times different from the current time (offset from the current time). These improved drive options could be implemented in a similar fashion than the node and element plugin variables.
