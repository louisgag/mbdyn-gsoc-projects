It would be nice if every MBDyn joint could optionally add friction to its internal forces and moments.

Thus, a possible to-do list for the project would be:

 - improve the friction model and add it to all joints (suggestion: try a transition force from stick to slip that is higher than slip force)
 - implement contacts with non-flat surfaces
