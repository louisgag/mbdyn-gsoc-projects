The configuration of MBDyn can benefit from some improvements which would make it easier to use by a greater number of users. The tasks involved are:

- test for '_' appended to F77 symbols (recent autoconf does that), (or better: remove all F77 code)
- audit all the suite for not-so-GNU systems
- add check for make
