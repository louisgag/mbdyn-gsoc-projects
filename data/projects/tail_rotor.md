One of MBDyn's specialities is flight dynamics modeling, especially concerning rotorcrafts. 
Several purposely-developed simulations entities exists to make it easy for the user to 
implement their own models but to date, the list doesn't comprehend any kind of tail rotor
model. 

The purpose of this project is to fill this gap by implementing several tail rotor models, of different complexity level.
For example, the list might comprise: 
- a simple **actuator-disc** model;
- ...
