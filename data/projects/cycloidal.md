During the GSoC2016 a double multiple streamtube inflow model for [cycloidal rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclorotor) was implemented into MBDyn.
The code can be seen [here](https://www.mbdyn.org/?News&id=28).
It is desired to improve the current implementation by, for example, mitigating the following limitations:

- Fixed divergence issues by carefully checking and fixing the code
- Perform validation tests with experimental results
- Implement averaging and filtering

For this project, the student should review the work done during 2016 and come up with his/her own suggestions.
