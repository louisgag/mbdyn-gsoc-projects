TODO: break into 4 steps...

The GSoC 2016 entry test requires prospective applicants to:

- compile MBDyn (on Linux) with support for run-time loadable modules (see the related FAQ for instructions)

- develop a simple run-time loadable module that implements a custom instance of one of:

 - a drive caller,

 - a constitutive law,

 - an element,

 - anything else;

- develop a simple model (an input file) that demonstrates the (correct) use of the custom module.
    name the module "module-gsoc-your-name.cc"


The module must compile and work as documented (by the applicant).

The objective and the purpose of the module can be discussed (the preferred channel is the mailing list).

Applicants are invited to look at distributed modules (in the "modules/" folder) as useful working examples; non-creative copy’n’paste is discouraged.


The project proposed in the application does not need to be related to the module that is developed as the entry test.  The latter is simply an entry test, intended to discourage applicants that are not enough motivated.
