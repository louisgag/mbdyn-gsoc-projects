Being selected to do the GSoC with MBDyn depends on many factors out of your control
such as the number of applicants and the number of slots we have available.
However, based on our experience over the past 3 years we can say that if you complete
the entry test **properly** you have **very very high probabilty of being selected**.

Why? Because:

- the entry test is difficult

- most students have a hard time going beyond step 2

- MBDyn is a software that, for most of the projects, requires skills from both C++ programming and mechanical engineering
