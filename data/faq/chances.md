Being selected to do the GSoC with MBDyn depends on many factors out of your control
such as the number of applicants and the number of slots we have available.
However, based on our experience over the past 3 years we can say that if you complete
the entry test **properly** you have **very very high probabilty of being selected**.

Why? Because:

- the entry test is difficult

- most students have a hard time going beyond step 2

- developing for MBDyn requires very specific skills (among them, for most of the projects, C++ programming and an understanding of general concepts of multibody dynamics) that are difficult to find in students at your level
