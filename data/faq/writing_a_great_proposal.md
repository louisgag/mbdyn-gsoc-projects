Please design your project in a way that you have **multiple
checkpoints**. We'd like you to specify at least three milestones with
specific goals: if something goes wrong for a valid reason, we can rearrange
your schedule meaningfully. Each of those goals has to be merged into the main
coala codebase in order for it to be considered"complete". You should be
aware of what that involves for you (writing tests, writing docs, going
through extensive code review, learning :), reiterating).

You can use any project idea listed here or one that came out of your mind -
however be sure to make us aware of your plans and start planning your project
with us so we can coordinate and - in the worst case - prohibit waste of time
from your side. At all cost make sure you find something that interests you.
We want this to be a fun and educating experience for you!

Use the"draft" feature on the GSoC system, submit your draft early, get a
lot of helpful feedback from us!


#### Writing the proposal

Please follow the **proposal template** at [PSF-ApplicationTemplate2016](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/ApplicationTemplate2016). All fields are required if not explicitly indicated otherwise. While following the application template you can consider doing an illustration of your proposed solution as it makes the application much more intuitive.

For writing your proposal we recommend using [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) as this will be supported by the Google submission system.

**In the `code sample` section:** Please list links to your contributions to coala **or any other OpenSource project**. Your contributions may or may not be available on github or related to coala!
For example, to list your contributions to coala you can mention:
 - https://github.com/coala/coala/commits/master?author=YOUR_USER_NAME for coala repo
 - https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/commits/master?author=YOUR_USER_NAME for coala-bears repo
You may also mention specific issues/commits using the commit id if you want us to take a look at that.

**In the `extra information` section:** We'd like the following sub-org specific info for coala:

- Will you be able to join us for a conference such as EuroPython or GUADEC and present your work if at least partial sponsorship will be provided? (See https://github.com/coala/coala/wiki/Conferences-Upcoming)
- We love having twitter handles so we can tell people publicly about your great project and successes at <https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer>! (Not required but recommended.)
